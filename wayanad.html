       <p class="ddetails"><b>Wayanad</b>  district in the north-east of Kerala, India, was formed on November 1, 1980 as 
        the 12th district by carving out areas from Kozhikode and Kannur districts. Kalpetta is the district headquarters 
        as well as the only municipal town in the district. The region was known as Mayakshetra (Maya's land) in the earliest
         records. Mayakshetra evolved into Mayanad and finally to Wayanad. The Folk etymology of the word says it is a combination
          of Vayal (paddy field) and Naad (land), making it 'The Land of Paddy Fields'. There are many indigenous tribals in this
           area. It is set high on the Western Ghats with altitudes ranging from 700 to 2100 m. Wayanad enjoys a salubrious climate
            throughout the year. The mean average rain fall in this district is 2322 m.m. Lakkidi, Vythiri and Meppadi are the high
             rainfall areas in Wayanad. Annual rain fall in these high rain fall areas ranges from 3,000 to 4,000m.m. High velocity
              winds are common during the south west monsoon and dry winds blow in March-April. High altitude regions experience 
              severe cold. At Ambalavayal in Wayanad, the Tribes in wayanadmean maximum and minimum temperature for the last five 
              years were 29oC and 18oC respectively. This place experiences a high relative humidity which goes even up to 95

                monsoon(October-November). The dale Lakkidi, nestled among the hills of Vythiri taluk, has the highest average 
                rainfall in Kerala.The misty environs of Wayanad offer a wide range of trekking opportunities, plantation visits and wildlife tours.
