       <p class="ddetails"><b>Palakkad</b> district (Malayalam: പാലക്കാട് ജില്ല) is one of the 14 districts of the Indian state of Kerala. The city of Palakkad is the district headquarters. Palakkad is bordered on the northwest by the Malappuram District, on the southwest by the Thrissur District and on the east by Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu. The district is 13.62% urbanised. The district is nicknamed "the granary of Kerala" and "rice bowl of Kerala". 
        Palakkad district has its own special characteristics. The fort of Hyder Ali tells us the story of Mysore invasions and the advent of the British to this part of the country. The Victoria College, started in 1886, marks the beginning of higher education in Malabar. The Jain temple near Chunnamputhara speaks of the magnanimity of the king of Palakkad who provided shelter to the people who escaped the religious persecutions.

The ancient history of Palakkad is shrouded. According to William Logan, the author of the Malabar Manual, the Pallava dynasty of Kanchi might have invaded Malabar in the second or third centuary. One of their head quarters was a place called Palakada which could be the present day Palakkad. Malabar had been invaded by many of the ancient South Indian rulers. For many centuries, it was ruled by the Perumals. They had under them some powerful Utayavars who held authority in their own respective territories. After the rule of the Perumals, the country was divided among these chieftans. The valluvakkonathiri (ruler of Valluvanad), the rulers of Vengunad (Kollengodu Rajas) andf Sekhari Varma ( Raja of Palakkad) were the prominent rulers of this region, after the Perumals.
