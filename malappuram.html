         district. The hilly district of Malappuram falls among the northern districts in the state of Kerala. Closely bordered by the mountain ranges of the Western Ghats on its east, and flanked by the Arabian Sea on the West, Malappuram has an eventful history with the Zamorins of Kozhikode ruling the region for a significant period in the past. The district has also witnessed several local uprisings against the British rule, and was once a prominent center for Hindu-Vedic learning and Islamic philosophy. Historic monuments, natural attractions, ritual art forms, ethnic cuisine and age-old traditions make Malappuram a unique destination for travelers.

         The District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) is set up with the purpose of fully exploiting the tourism potential of the State through sustained efforts by co-ordinating various Government departments, voluntary agencies and others interested in travel and tourism. Three rivers, namely Chaliyar, Bharathapuzha and Kadalundi, flow through the land of Malappuram enriching both its soil and its culture. The powerful army of the Zamorins kings of Calicut was headquartered here in the olden days. The name of the district is marked in the history of Indian nationalism for being the venue for Khilafat Movement and Mopila Revolt. Malappuram is the birth place of the Muslim dance form, Oppana.
