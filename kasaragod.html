        organised as a separate district on 24 May 1984. It is the northernmost district of Kerala and is named after Kasaragod Town 
        which is the administrative headquarters of the district. The district has a coastline of around 293 kilometers and that why 
        the livelihood of Kasargod people mainly depends on fisheries. The district is popular with the <i><b>forts, rivers, hillocks, 
        beaches</b></i> and <i><b>shrines</b></i> here. The Kasargod District is uniquely known for its <i><b>Linguistics Culture</b></i> and it is the best example for 
        the <i><b>"Linguistic Harmony"</b></i>. Off the radar for commoners and the land of exquisite folk art, tourist places 
        in Kasaragod are reserved for hardcore and offbeat travelers in troops, pair or alone any time of the day and year. 
        Early morning while your vision is still hazy your ears will automatically attune to the blissful soundscape.
        Hosting numerous wildlife sanctuaries, temple protected by a ‘croc’ - say the locals and magnificent hills, 
        Kasaragod is uptown in all aspects. The ultimate traveling destination, has it all to enchant you. 
        The natives are very friendly and the harmony between people of various religions is to be highlighted.
        A rare district in India housing seven languages and vivid appreciable cultures. Also, experience the 
        Malabar coastal winds you have been reading about in Geography all this while. Get set to be awestruck and jaw dropped 
        to find manmade and nature blend at its best at Kasaragod.
